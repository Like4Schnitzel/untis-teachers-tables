# untis-teachers-tables
Does your school block students from viewing teachers' timetables for some reason? This is the workaround!

This gets the week's timetable for every room and then stitches those together so you only see the lessons with the teacher you're looking for. Since this makes a lot of requests very quickly you should probably limit your usage. I am not liable if your account gets banned/blocked, use at your own risk.
